        <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
        <p>Pair programming is a technique that originates from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile software development</a >.<br><br>  It involves the coordination of efforts of two individuals on the same code.  While both are working, only one is typing while the other dictates.<br><br> In order to progress, it is necessary to  maintain communication and clear dialogue.  Through this communication, knowledge is shared, problems are solved more quickly, new solutions are discovered, and errors are caught by an extra set of eyes.</p>

        <h2>Why is it important to DBC?</h2>
        <p>Pair programming is very useful for Dev Bootcamp.  <br><br>

It allows the transfer of knowledge between students, especially those who may be at different stages in learning.  Each student comes in to the session with their own perspective and set of skills. <br><br>
It is also a great teaching tool for a student to solidify their learning by teaching a new concept to another student.  In the pairing situation, students learn faster.<br><br>
The extra set of eyes on the project also helps to catch errors or fix bugs.  One student may catch what another misses<br><br>
Pair programming is also useful for maintaining focus on a project.  When working with a pair, the student has no choice but to focus on the work rather than succumb to distractions.</p>

        <h2>Comparing Driver &amp Navigator Roles</h2>
        <p>In pair programming, seeing as only one person is typing, roles are divided between "Driver" and "Navigator."  <br><br>
While only the driver types, the Navigator leads and dictates what the Driver should be typing.  This is not to say that the Driver just sits back and takes orders from the Navigator. There should be dialogue and collaboration in order to solve problems. <br><br>
Of course, the roles are not fixed.  They can switch at any time.  It is always recommended for pairs to switch roles at some point in the session.</p>

        <h2>My First Pair Programming Experience</h2>
        <p> I felt that my first experience pair programming at Dev Bootcamp was extremely beneficial.<br><br>  I was able to achieve intense focus with my partner.  We helped each other by talking our way through the problem, coming to solutions quickly.  I learned things from him, and he learned things from me as well.<br><br>  The project was completed much faster and more efficiently than if either of us had been working on it on our own.  It also had fewer errors, since we were able to check each other as we worked.
