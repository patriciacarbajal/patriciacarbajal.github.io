        <p>In the past couple of months as I have worked through Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp, I have been given several blog assignments. These are the blogposts that have populated my blog up until now.</p>
        <p>By writing these reflections and explanations of what I have been learning, I have solidified my knowledge on the topics I write about.</p>
        <p>As they say, the best way to test if you understand a concept is trying to teach it to somebody else. Many of my blogging assignments have been to do just that: Explain a concept to someone who does not have a technical background. I can definitely vouch for the effectiveness of the exercises. By writing these posts, I have a gained a deeper understanding of the material I've been learning.</p>

        <p>Relatedly, my most recent assignment was to revamp my website and set up my own personal domain. I had a lot of fun completely redesigning the site, now that I have a little more knowledge than when I initially designed it. I also managed to snag my name as a domain, which I'm pretty excited about.</p> 
        <p>Let me know what you think!</p>
