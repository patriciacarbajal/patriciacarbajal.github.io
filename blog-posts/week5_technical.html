      <div id="post-text">

<p>Today I am going to talk a bit about Ruby classes.</p>

<p>A class is basically a blueprint, or model, for creating new objects.  Each object created by a particular class will share, or inherit, its assigned properties and methods.</p>


<p>To help illustrate, I've written a silly class about farm animals.</p>

<img src="../FarmAnimals.jpg">

<p>The class is initialized to accept 3 arguments: name, age, and species.  In the commonly used initialized method, each argument is assigned to an <i>instance variable</i>.  These are denoted by the @ symbol preceding the variable name.  Instance variables are visible only within the class and objects created by the class.  Without the @ symbol, we would not be able to use these variables in the different methods throughout the class.</p>


<p>You'll notice the "attr_accessor" at the top.  This allows access to those variables throughout the code.  More on this later.</p>


<p>In the sounds method, I illustrate how the instance variables can be used throughout the different methods in the class.  Using a case statement, I create a new instance variable, @sound, with a different sound depending on the species passed in as an argument.</p>


<p>Finally, in the description method, a string is printed to the screen with the values from the previous class methods passed in.</p>




<p>Let's test it out.</p>

<img src="../FarmAnimals2.jpg">


<p>When we create a new class using FarmAnimals.new(name, age, species), it creates a new instance of a FarmAnimal object.  </p>


<p>animal1 and animal2 are variables that point to these objects.</p>


<p>We can print the description for each FarmAnimal object by calling the description method on the object variable:  </p>


<p>puts animal2.description</p>


<p>Now back to attr_accessor!  Notice how I changed the species of animal2 from chicken to pig, and the description was updated to reflect these changes?  Try running the code without attr_accessor - it won't work!  attr_accessor allows you "access," if you will, to make such changes.  Oink!</p>
