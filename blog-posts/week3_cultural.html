    <h2 class="post-title">Gregorc Thinking Style and Fixed vs. Growth Mindsets</h2>
      <h4>September 10, 2014</h4>
      <div id="post-text">
<h2>Thinking Style</h2>

<p>My <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc thinking style</a>, according to the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">quiz</a>, is equally Abstract Random and Concrete Random.  This makes me an "experimenter" who "organizes information through reflection, who "thrives in unstructured, people-oriented environments."  It also means that I don't usually have a plan, and learn in disorganized chunks. This is very true. My thought process is definitely random and experimental.  I find it difficult to focus during long lectures or reading several chapters of a textbook (which, I'm sure, is true of almost everybody!).  I feel that I learn best in an activity where I am able to apply the information being taught in a real-life application or example. </p>

<p>Luckily, it feels like Dev Bootcamp's teaching method is geared toward people with my thinking style.  There is a lot of group work and real-life application of learning material, which is great for me.</p>

<p>So far in Phase 0, my biggest struggle has been the self-education model of learning online, which is an issue related to my thinking style.  I prefer to be in a classroom where I can ask questions and get instant feedback.  However, since that is not possible at this stage, it does help tremendously to have peer programming sessions regularly and have access to tutoring sessions and office hours if needed.  I have not used the tutoring or office hour resources yet, but I plan to take advantage of them the next time I am having trouble understanding something.</p>

<h2>Fixed vs. Growth Mindset</h2>

<p>The fixed mindset is driven by ego, wants to prove superior intelligence and avoid failure at all costs - even when that means avoiding teaching situations in which one might fail while learning. </p>
<p>The growth mindset disregards the need to prove oneself, seeking growth opportunities that can be learned from, and accepting the fact that one might fail while attempting it.  Much can be learned through failure, which makes it valuable rather than something to avoid.</p>
<p>While at Dev Bootcamp, I am going to actively work on expanding the way I learn and think in order to enhance my learning abilities.  This means I will be open to trying new things without being afraid of not getting it at first.  I will also start planning and organizing my work, instead of flying by the seat of my pants as I have always done.  I know that this is a very valuable skill for me to develop, and it seems especially necessary in a learning situation such as Dev Bootcamp. </p>
