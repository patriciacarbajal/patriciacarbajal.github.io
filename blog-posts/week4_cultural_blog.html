    <h2 class="post-title">Women in the Tech World</h2>
      <h4>September 14, 2014</h4>
      <div id="post-text">

<p>One of the most-discussed problems facing the tech world is the issue of misogyny and sexism against women.  <a href=“http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html?_r=0”>This article</a> from the New York Times gives a thorough overview of the current state of affairs from different viewpoints.</p>

<p>According to the article, women hold only a quarter of all information technology jobs.  Of those women, the quit rate is a staggering 56%.</p>

<p>It is common for women in the tech industry to report harassment and suggestive comments, dismissal of expertise, and disrespect.  In order to fit in to the "bro" culture of their workspace, women often have to put up with and try to ignore a lot of negativity from their colleagues.</p>

<p>However, there is hope.  Not all women report these dismal work conditions. Sarah Chipps, chief technology officer of The Flatiron School in New York, says, "I've been doing this 10 years, and myself and everyone I've spoken to who's a female developer has had an amazing experience in the developer community."</p>

<p> Furthermore, I have been noticing the number of women studying code in Dev Bootcamp and elsewhere.  More women are starting to consider tech as a career, and this will undoubtably force change in the industry as the demographics shift. </p>

<p>While change is likely, it will be slow, and continued dialogue and awareness is necessary to make it a reality.</p>
