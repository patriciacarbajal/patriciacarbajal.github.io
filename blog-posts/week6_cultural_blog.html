    <h2 class="post-title">Identity  and Stereotype Threat</h2>
      <h4>October 3, 2014</h4>
      <div id="post-text">

<p>The term Stereotype Threat was coined by social scientists Steele and Aronson in 1995.  According to their work, stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group.  Since then, hundreds of studies have been conducted along these lines, with many confirmations of the theory.</p>
<p>Dr. Claude Steele, social psychologist, gave a fantastic lecture on the topic of identity and stereotype threat to Colombia University, which can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">here</a>.  (The lecture starts about 8 minutes in).</p>
<p>Dr. Steele made the following key points:<p>
  <ul>
<li>The most psychologically impactful identity contingencies are those that in some way threaten the individual.</li>
<li>If you care about what you are doing, and perceive that your identity contingency is negatively judged in that situation, it can interfere with your functioning in that situation.</li>
<li>Cues that signal threatening contingencies foster vigilance and hamper a sense of belonging in the setting.  This, in turn, impairs learning and performance.</li>
<li>Prefrontal context activity is suppressed, hampering performance, and activity in the amygdala increases in response to threatening cues in the situation.  The reverse happens when threat is removed, and performance improves.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>My Experience</b></p>

<p>I personally identify with two identity contingencies that are commonly subjected to stereotype threat:  I am a woman, and I am Hispanic.<p>

<p>I do not think that my identity has affected my achievement, however.  I have always excelled in academics, scoring high on tests and getting very good perfect grades in school.  I have sometimes felt that I was being judged for my gender or my race, but I have been confident in my abilities to defy these stereotypes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, going into the field of computer science has been more difficult for me in this regard compare to my previous experience in Political Science.   The tech industry is notorious for being hostile toward women, which is one of the reason there are such few women working in it.</p>

<p>When people find out that I am studying programming and web development, they are often taken aback.  I do not fit the typical profile.  They ask me why I decided to do such a thing, and warn me of the harassment I will face in my work.</p>

<p>I am  not worried about it.  I feel that I have been strong enough in my academic career thus far to come out triumphant, knocking down stereotypes along the way.</p>
