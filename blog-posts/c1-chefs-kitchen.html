        I just finished watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat video</a>.  Although it echoed a lot of what I read in my research on Dev Bootcamp, I feel more confident and prepared for what I'm about to go through in the next few weeks after watching it.  Dev Bootcamp, from my opinion, looks like a unique and innovative program that I am excited to have the opportunity to be a part of.  I am really looking forward to phase 1 when we begin to really sink our teeth into the work and dive into it.  <br>
I liked Shereef's "restaurant vs kitchen" analogy to describe how to deal with expectations going into DBC.  There is the "restaurant" mentality, in which students go into the program having paid the fee, expecting to be served the knowledge on a platter without putting out effort.  More conducive to a dynamic learning environment, however, is the "kitchen" mentality, in which students go in with their sleeves rolled up and aprons on, ready to make it happen themselves and take charge of their own experience.  This gave me something to think about.  <br>
I am definitely very nervous to participate in this kind of learning environment, but to say I'm excited would be an understatement!</p>
