<h2>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</h2>
  <p>JavaScript has become extremely popular in web development for several reasons.  It is lightweight, and can produce fast, dynamic, asynchronous web and mobile applications.  </p>
  <p>While it had previously fallen out of favor, Google brought JavaScript back into the mainstream by using it in the wildly popular Gmail and Google Maps web applications in 2004 and 2005.</p>
  <p>The rise of Node.js, which uses the Google V8 JavaScript engine, creates scalable, event-driven, asynchronous applications in JavaScript.</p>
  <p>Web developers now also have jQuery, JSON, and HTML5 (which is more about JavaScript than HTML), for which JavaScript in an essential component.  It has become necessary for web developers to become fluent in JavaScript, which has become dubbed "the language of the web." </p>

<h2>What are the great things about JavaScript?</h2>

<p>JavaScript has several positives.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Relatively very easy to learn</li>
    <li>Huge open source community</li>
    <li>Fast speed on user end</li>
    <li>Client side - reduces load on the server</li>
    <li>Can provide offline functionality</li>
    <li>Has an extensive collection of libraries available</li>
    <li>Lets you use AJAX</li>


<h2>What are its limitations?</h2>

  <p>JavaScript, while popular and very useful, is not without its disadvantages.</p>
  <p>Security breaches are a concern.  Malicious code can be snuck in though JavaScript snippets on web pages, since it executes instantly on client servers.</p>
  <p>JavaScript layouts can also render inconsistently in functionality and interface since there is no strict universal standard.  This can be very frustrating to web developers.</p>

  <p>Javascript is also one of the most unreliable languages in cross-browser testing.</p>
