        <p>Want to learn faster?  Ask more questions.</p>  
        <p>Better yet, ask BETTER questions.</p>

<p>Knowing how to ask good questions will not only raise your chances of getting an answer, but will also improve the quality and relevance of the answer you receive.</p> <br><br>

<p>Here are some tips for crafting the perfect question:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First of all, do your research.  If you Google your question, using key words, you may be surprised how many times it has been asked (and answered) before.  Look through the results and see if your question can be solved without even asking.  <a href="www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> is usually a great resource for this.</li>

<li><p>If you do not find a suitable answer to your question, then research the best forum in which to post your question.  Make sure you post in the right section, where the question is not off-topic.    Again, Stack Overflow is an excellent place to start.</p></li>

<li><p>Write out your question.  Then step back and read it as if you were your reader, relying on your words for all context.  Does the question make sense to you?  Putting yourself in the shoes of the reader with no context, does the question raise any new questions for you?
  <p>If so, address these questions.  Improve upon your question until you can imagine no doubts in the reader's understanding.</p></li>

<li><p>Titles are hugely important when it comes to asking questions on online forums.  Would-be answerers are scrolling down the screen, and you want your question to grab their interest!  </p>
<p>It is best to write the title in the form of a question when possible.  It should be concise but specific and descriptive, capturing the essence of the question.  Make sure the title has meaning on its own. "Why doesn't this work?" is not sufficient.  You want the reader to get the gist of what you are asking before even reading your actual question.</p></li>

<li><p>You can communicate even more details by using tags for things like platform and language version, operating system, relevant software, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Be sure to include the results of your research.   What did you find?  Why didn't this work for you?  What problems did you have?  Not only will this help people answer your question properly, but it will also show that you have put your effort in rather than just relying on answers without trying.</p></li>


<li><p>When asking the actual question, be sure that your objective is crystal clear.  </p></li>
Do not simply state that when you tried to do something, it did not work.  What was the problem, exactly?  What have you tried, and how did these attempts fail?  If you got an error message, include it - including the lines of code that triggered it.</p></li>

<li><p> Include sample code if possible, but make sure to format it properly and keep include only the relevant parts.  Nobody wants to sift through lines of code that do not directly pertain to your question. Again, make sure the everything is clear.  </p></li>

<li><p>Be sure to proofread your question.  Make sure there are no spelling or grammar mistakes, and that it flows well.  </p></li>

<li><p>When somebody answers your question, reply.  Did they solve your problem?  Thank them.  Was their question not quite what you were looking for?  Let them know.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With these guidelines you should be on your way to getting the best answers to your questions.</p>
