    <h2 class="post-title">Design analysis of my favorite websites</h2>
      <h4>August 30, 2014</h4>
  <div id="post-text">

<p>For my first blog post for Dev Bootcamp, I've been given the task to analyze the design of my three favorite websites: Reddit.com, Lifehacker.com, and Buzzfeed.com according to the guidelines below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</li>
  <li>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</li>
  <li>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "well-branded", "minimalist", "organized", "cluttered", "dated" etc)</li>
  <li>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</li>
  <li>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "entertaining", "aspirational", "informative", "engaging" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</li>
  <li>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?
  <li>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</li>
  <li>How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)</li>
  <li>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</li>
</ul>

Design analysis of Reddit.com:
Reddit.com is one of my favorite sites because I can find virtually any information I am looking for here.  It is not a fancy site full of graphics or animation, but it is incredibly well organized.
When looking at the home page, your eye is drawn to the feed of trending subreddits from all over the site.  These are the most popular posts, so they are featured here.<br>
Visually, I would describe the site as organized, minimalist, simple, and ultra-compartmentalized.
Reddit solves many problems: boredom, search for information, advice/guidance, entertainment, research, etc.  If you can think of a topic, there is probably a subreddit forum dedicated to it.
In regard to content/focus/purpose, I'd describe the site as engaging, addictive, informative, entertaining, and practical.<br>
From the homepage, it is easy to find whatever you are looking for either from the search bar or one of the many links to popular categories.  You can access these from any page, not just the home page. While it would be impossible to browse all of the content of the site, it is very easy to find the content you are searching for.  After a while on the site, depending on what I am looking at, I can feel happy, entertained, informed, and often like I wasted a lot of time because the site tends to keep you there and suck you in like a temporal black hole.  Luckily, the site has nothing to sell, either.

  <p class="site">Design analysis of Lifehacker.com:
Lifehacker.com is one of my favorite sites because it has taught me so much on practically every topic I have desired to learn about.  It really does make you feel like you are hacking your life, learning secret tricks to make it easier. It is a great resource full of useful information.<br>
When on the homepage, the eye is drawn to their latest feature story, which takes up most of the screen.  It is probably what they consider the most important article of the moment on their site.
Visually, I'd describe the site as organized, current, minimalist, clear, and focused.<br>
Lifehacker.com solves the problem of a user's lack of knowledge due to inexperience.  It is full of articles written by people with experience in a certain area who offer "lifehacks," or tricks to make things easier that most people are not aware of.  Its content ranges from advice on managing your financial life, to relationship advice, to advice on the best gadgets to purchase and the best time to buy them.  The content, focus and purpose of the site can be described as informative, practical, engaging, useful, and thought-provoking - in line with their visual design.<br>
It is very easy to find what you are looking for using the search feature on the homepage.  Once you are on another page, there are links geared toward the topic you are reading about, which is very helpful.  It would take an incredibly long time to browse though all of the content on the site, but it is very well organized.  After being on the site for a while I feel like I have learned valuable information and am able to make more informed decisions in my life.  Thankfully, lifehacker does not sell anything.

<p class="site">Design analysis of Buzzfeed.com:
Buzzfeed.com is one of my favorite sites because of it's often hiliarious or useful content.  It is overflowing with content in practically every category you can imagine, from funny animals to pumpkin recipies.  When looking at the homepage, the eye is drawn literally everywhere.  Aside from one feature image that is larger than the rest, there doesn't seem to be much of a focal point, as everything is vying to be the focal point.  It is cluttered, overwhelming, and a bit disorganized, but also condensed and informative.<br>
Buzzfeed solves the problems of boredom while at the same time providing information.  There are pages devoted soley to entertainment, while others teach the user useful knowledge.  The content is funny, entertaining, often practical, informative and engaging.  It is very easy to find what you are looking for through their search feature.  They also suggest similar pages from their site based upon your selections once you're off the homepage.  It would take an impossibly long time to browse the entire content of the site, by the sheer size of it.<br>
I feel satisfied after being on the site for a while.  It makes me laugh and teaches me new tricks, and they don't try to sell me anything.
